# Exercise 1

1. Setup the array below in your code.

```javascript
const colors = [
  { id: 1, name: 'red' },
  { id: 2, name: 'blue' },
  { id: 3, name: 'green' },
] 
```

2. Create a new color object with a unique id and add it to the array.

- Using the Math.max function and the Array Map function, please calculate the next id value.  To make this work, look at using the spread operator with function arguments.

- Add the new color object to the array immutably

3. Output both the original array and the new array AFTER performing the add.
